## How to Run Scripts
### Data Cleaning Scripts
- `checkNullandTypeError.py`  
To run this script, you need to upload the `crimedata.csv` to HDFS.
Then use command ` spark-submit checkNullandTypeError.py`. Information we need will be printed on the screen.

- `CleanData.py`  
Input of this script is the original `crimedata.csv`.
Output file is called `cleanedData.csv`. Delimiter in this file is `*`. Data we don't need are no longer in this file.


### Data Analysis Scripts
The following scripts assume that `cleanedData.csv` has been put in HDFS. To run those scripts, use command `spark-submit FILENAME.py`.

- `boroCrime.py`  
  For each borough, count each kind of law category (e.g. felony).  
  This script produces output file `boroCrimeLevel.csv`.  
  Output data columns: (BORO_NM, LAW_CAT_CD, COUNT)  

- `boroKycd.py`  
	For each borough, count each type of crime (incident code).  
	This script produces output file `boroKycd.csv`.  
	Output data columns: (BORO_NM, KY_CD, COUNT)  

- `boroPrem.py`  
	For each borough, count each type of premises where crimes happened.  
	This script produces output file `boroPrem.csv`.  
	Output data columns: (BORO_NM, PREM_TYPE_DESC, COUNT)  

- `crimeRet.py`  
	For each type of crime, count each type of CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD (e.g. Completed, Attempted).  
	This script produces output file `crimeRet.csv`.  
	Output data columns: (KY_CD, CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD, COUNT).  

- `crimeTime.py`  
	Find out how many each type of crimes started at each hour of a day.  
	This script produces output file `keyCode2Time.csv`.  
	Output data columns: (KY_CD, HOUR(CMPLNT_FR_TM), COUNT)  

- `keycode2desc.py`  
	Associate incident code with its description.  
	This script produces output file `keyCode2desc.csv`.  
	Output data columns: (KY_CD, OFNS_DESC, COUNT)  

- `kycdCount.py`  
	Count each type of crime (incident code).  
	This script produces output file `kycdCount.csv`  
	Output data columns: (KY_CD, COUNT)  

- `lawProportion.py`  
	For each type of crime level (e.g. felony), count each type of CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD (e.g. Attempted).  
	This script produces output file `lawProportion.csv`  
	Output data columns: (LAW_CAT_CD, CRM_ATPT_CPTD_CD, COUNT)  


### Data Visualization Scripts
- `/GraphSave/index.html` and `/GraphSave/draw.js` `draw2.js` ... `draw5.js`  
	These are used to draw the summary charts for report.  
	You need to start a Python server to run these code.  
	Notice that you have to manually modify the code in index.html to call different JS files.  

- `GenerateDrawData.py`  
	This script is not for HPC. The input is cleaned data. Output is the two columns in the orginal data: `latitude` and `longitude`. Information about	these data will also be printed on the screen.

- `drawmap.py`  
	This script is not for HPC. It just calls Pillow to draw a distribution graph based on the latitude and longitude data. Output is a PNG picture.
